# BuildTogether
An open-source project aims to give people the opportunity to work together under a team where they can learn from each other, and get their skills to a high level, and also get used to the team spirit that they will need when they reach a job. // remember we are here to learn from our failures

# What's the project Idea?

It's a secure vote web App, where people can vote, it's simple as it's.

# what tech are we going to use?

The project is a web App. first of all, we are implementing the clean architectue, the reason why -> just google it mate. 
so we will use a javascript framewok for the frontend, it's gon'be Vue (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/), cuz it's simple to use, and node.js&Express.js for the backend (https://nodejs.org/en/docs/). for the vote encryption, we will use kbpgp.js (https://book.keybase.io/guides/pgp-in-javascript)

Note: we can accept any Node.js dependency, it just has to fit our project.

# Guidelines for all contributors

1-  First of all, u have to take a look at the Issues section in order to have an idea about the issue which was assigned to u.


2- Make sure that u r in master branch then pull and fetch the master branch.                                                                                     
     command lines -> git branch ( it gives u the branch which where u r ).                                                                                       
                   -> git checkout master ( switch to the master branch ).                                                                                         
                   -> git fetch.                                                                                                                                   
                   -> git pull -u origin master  ( Update ur local master to move on).                                                                             

3- Then create a branch has the same name of the issue.                                                                        
   make sure u r in the master branch (that's important, if u create a branch based on other branch instead 
   of the master branch, u would f*** us mate, Not really, but it will lead to problems in our workflow .... be careful, please )
   then try this following command in order to create the new branch based on the master.                                                                         
      command lines -> git checkout -b  ur_github_username/branchName    (exemple : med_dp/make_the_details_file)
                      
4.1- Then do ur magic.                                                                                                             
4.2- when u r working on the issue, make sure you do Commits frequently in order to explain what u r doing.                        
4.3- each commit shall contain the '#NumberIssue' ( take a look, each issue has an ID, exemple: 'the first commit #15').                                           
4.3- Also if u feel that the process is in progress, it would be better if u move it from the ToDo column to the In progress column, so we know that all is fine with u.                                                                                        

5- After doing ur magic, push the branch to the repo, so we can test it and merge it to the master.                                
         command lines -> git push -u origin ur_github_username/branchName                                                         
   the last thing comment the name of the branch on the issue post.                                      
   
# Note that this is just the first project. we are aiming to put devs and designers on a lot of other really interesting projects.
   # Thank you all
